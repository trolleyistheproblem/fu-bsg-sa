        Suppose in a group, 1 participant contributed ₹8, 1 participant contributed ₹4, 1 participant contributed ₹5, 1 participant contributed ₹3 and 1 participant contributed ₹0 . What would be the individual share of each participant?
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Solution: ₹12</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> Total contribution from all participants was ₹8 + ₹4 + ₹0 + ₹5 + ₹3 = ₹20. Total earnings from the project were ₹20*3 = ₹60.
        Each participant got an equal share of the earnings, that is, ₹60/5= ₹12. This will be the individual share for each participant.
