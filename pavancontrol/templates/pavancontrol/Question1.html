<tr><td>In this study, you will be in a group of 5 people chosen at random, and you will play 12 rounds of this game. You will be given an <b> endowment</b> of {{ Constants.endowment }} each round to use to make a joint investment with the group. Each player decides how much he/she contributes to investment. This will be your round <b>contribution</b> Each round, your contribution can be any amount from ₹0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}. Your <b>round total</b> (round total = individual share + amount not contributed) will be calculated as follows: <ul> <li>In each round, the contributions of all 5 members are added up.</li> <li>The total is then is multiplied by {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }}.</li> <li>After being multiplied by {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }}, the new total is evenly split among the 5 members in that round. This will be your <b>individual share</b>.</li></ul> At the end of the rounds, you will get to keep your individual share, plus the amount you did not contribute at the start of each round. There will be 12 rounds and the entire process will take 30 to 40 minutes. You can potentially earn up to ₹360 at the end of the game.</td></tr></p>
