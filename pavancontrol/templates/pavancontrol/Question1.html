<tr><td>In this study, you will be in a group of 5 players chosen at random, and you will play 12 rounds of this game. One or more of the players will be automated. You will be given an <b> endowment</b> of {{ Constants.endowment }} each round to use to make a joint investment with the group. Each player decides how much he/she puts into the investment. This will be your round <b>input</b>. Each round, your input can be any amount from ₹0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}. Your <b>round total</b> will be calculated as follows: <ul> <li>In each round, the inputs of all 5 members are added up.</li> <li>The total is then is multiplied by {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }}.</li> <li>After being multiplied by {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }}, the new total is evenly split among the 5 members in that round. This will be your <b>individual share</b>.</li></ul> At the end of the rounds, <b>you will get to keep your individual share, plus the amount you did not put in at the start of each round</b>. There will be 12 rounds and the entire process will take 30 to 40 minutes. You can potentially earn up to ₹360 at the end of the game.</td></tr></p>
