<p>
    You started with an endowment of {{ Constants.endowment }},
    of which you put in {{ player.contribution }}.
    Your group's total input was {{ group.total_contribution }},
    resulting in an individual share of {{ group.individual_share }}, for each player.
    Your round earning is therefore: {{ player.payoff }}.
